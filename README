A blockchain-based anonymous imageboard, written in OCaml.

This project aims to provide a simple imageboard.
It will remain as simple as possible, and as extendable as possible.
Blockchan tries not to lock up its users.

I) The Philosophy
KISS.

II) The client

The client is only expected to retrieve blocks from a server, save them to
the filesystem and propagate the outcomes of the transactions.
Displaying the data in an interface other than the filesystem is not a task
of the client.
It is up to the user to browse the filesystem using a text editor of their
choosing, or any other program.
The client is not expected to send data to the server directly, this is another
program's job. (Ideally, one would transmit data to the server via cURL)

III) The server

The server's only task is to receive requests from client and process them.
The server is also the central authority that is responsible of keeping track of
the blockchain. It has to be trustworthy.
Should it fail to appear so, one can, and should, start a server of his own
using his local copy of the blockchain and start advertising this fork of the
imageboard for everyone to use.
